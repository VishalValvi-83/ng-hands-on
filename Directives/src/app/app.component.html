<h1>Angular Directives</h1>

<section>
  <p>Welcome to the Angular Directives tutorial!</p>
  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn about the different types of directives in
    Angular, how to create custom directives, and how to use built-in directives
    effectively.</p>
  <p>Let's get started!</p>

  <h2>What are Directives?</h2>
  <p>Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your
    Angular applications. They can change the appearance or behavior of a DOM
    element, component, or another directive.</p>
  <p>There are three types of directives in Angular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Components</strong>: Directives with a template.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural Directives</strong>: Change the DOM layout by adding
      or removing elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute Directives</strong>: Change the appearance or behavior
      of an existing element.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Built-in Directives</h2>
  <p>Angular provides several built-in directives that you can use in your
    applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>*ngIf</strong>: Conditionally includes a template based on the
      value of an expression.</li>
    <li><strong>*ngFor</strong>: Repeats a template for each item in a
      collection.</li>
    <li><strong>*ngSwitch </strong>: Conditionally includes one of a set of
      templates based on the value of an expression.</li>
    <li><strong>ngClass</strong>: Adds or removes CSS classes based on an
      expression.</li>
    <li><strong>ngStyle</strong>: Adds or removes inline styles based on an
      expression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Structural Directives</h2>
  <p>Structural directives are responsible for shaping or reshaping the DOM's
    structure. They can add, remove, or manipulate elements in the DOM.</p>
  <p>Examples of structural directives include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>*ngIf</strong>: Used to conditionally include or exclude a
      template based on a boolean expression.
      If the expression evaluates to true, the template is included; otherwise,
      it is excluded.
      <div>
        Example:
        <button (click)="toggleVisibility()">{{Toggler}}</button>
        <!-- This content will be conditionally displayed based on isVisible
        -->
        <p *ngIf="isVisible">
          This content is conditionally displayed.
        </p>

      </div>
      <details>
        <summary>Example code of *ngIf</summary>
        <pre>
            &lt;!-- app.component.ts --&gt;
            <code>isVisible = true;</code>

            &lt;!-- app.component.html --&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;Angular Directives Example&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;button (click)="isVisible = !isVisible"&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;!-- This content will be conditionally displayed based on isVisible --&gt;
            &lt;div *ngIf="isVisible"&gt;
              This content is conditionally displayed.
            &lt;/div&gt;
          </pre>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ul>
